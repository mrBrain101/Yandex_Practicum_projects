# Hotel churn prediction.

## Problem.
Creating a model that predicts hotel room cancellations based on customer attributes.<br>
The model should pay for itself in a year on a budget of $400 000$р.
## Solution.
<li>A profitable system for predicting booking cancelations was developed.
<li>A research analysis was conducted and a portrait of the “unreliable” customer was drawn up.

## Steps:
<li>Exploratory data analysis.
<li>Data preprocessing.
<li>Classification model development and validation.
<li>Estimation of the profitability of the model.
  
## Utilized libraries and tools:
