# Statistical analysis of the scooter app clients' behavior.
<li>Analysis of travel parameters of customers of the scooter rental service “GoFast”.
<li>Tests of the following hypotheses that can help businesses grow:
<ul>
	<li>Do users with a subscription spend more time traveling?
	<li>Can we say that the distance traveled by subscription users per trip is less than 3130 meters?
	<li>Will the monthly revenue from users with subscriptions be higher by month than revenue from users without subscriptions?
	<li>Has the number of calls to tech support decreased meaningfully since the upgrade of the servers with which the app interacts?
</ul>
<li>Evaluation of the following parameters:
<ul>
	<li>Estimate the minimum number of promo codes that need to be sent out for the probability of 100 users not renewing their subscription to be ~5%.
	<li>Estimate the probability that if 1 million push notifications are sent out, they will be opened by no more than 399,500 users.
</ul>
