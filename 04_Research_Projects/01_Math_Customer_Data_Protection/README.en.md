# Protection of customer data. 

## Problem.
Development of a data transformation method (matrix transformations) that will protect customers' personal information and will not affect the results of insurance claims prediction.<br>
Validate the method on a linear regression model.<br>
## Solution.
The efficiency of the data protection algorithm using multiplication of independent features by a reversible matrix was proved.<br>
It was proved, theoretically and practically, that the efficiency of linear regression does not decrease at such transformation of predictors.
