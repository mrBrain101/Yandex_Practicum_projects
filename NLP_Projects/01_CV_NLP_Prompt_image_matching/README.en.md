# Image search by text prompt. 

## Problem.
MVP algorithm to search an image by text prompt.
## Solution.
For the demo version, an MVP model was trained, capable of outputting a number between 0 and 1 based on the vector representation of the image and the vector representation of the text - to show how well the text and image fit together.
